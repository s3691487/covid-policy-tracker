*  The covid-19 policy tracker is a mobile friendly web app developed and hosted in the cloud     *
*  platform that retrieves and presents real time data for covid cases and government policies    *
*  in different countries.                                                                        *
*                                                                                                 *
*  Through this web app, users can gather information about the current government policies in    *
*  different countries. It also tracks previous government policies back from 2020, when covid    *
*  first started. To help users understand the effectiveness of the policies, the app shows user  *
*  the number of covid cases in different countries on different dates, which can be used as a    *
*  clear indicator for policy effectiveness. Detailed government policies are listed so users     *
*  can find out what the exact policies are implemented on different dates. It also dynamically   *
*  generates a covid restriction level chart to help users estimate what restriction levels are   *
*  implemented on a monthly time frame.                                                           *
*                                                                                                 *
